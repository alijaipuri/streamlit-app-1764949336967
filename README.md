# 🎯 AI-Generated Streamlit App

> This application was automatically generated using AI technology.

## 📝 Description

Weather information is important for daily planning, travel, agriculture, and safety. However, many existing weather websites are cluttered or difficult to use. People often need a simple tool where they can quickly view the current weather and the forecast for the next few days.
The aim of this project is to build a Streamlit-based Weather Forecast Application that uses the OpenWeather API to show:
Current weather details for any city
7-day weather forecast
Visual charts for temperature, humidity, and other parameters
Weather icons and animations for a better user experience
Location-based weather fetching
This application will help users easily check the weather and plan their activities using a clean, interactive interface.
